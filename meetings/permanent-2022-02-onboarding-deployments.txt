Onboarding and deployments

Cecilia, Jason, Natalie

	1. PR #15 (Thursday) and PR #20(?)
		* Should not affect anyone else
	1. Front end flow in general (deploy to dev before merging for QA, first, presumably)
		* Some work is already merged - basic page available via url hacking, but not connected to any functionality
		* Current work:
			* wire that page up so that accounts without archives launches the new onboarding flow. In particular, invitations lead to no new archive.
			* Enforce URLs more strictly, to make sure users are in the next place: must be in onboard flow if no archives, can't use login page if already logged in.
			* Users who have no archives - they were invited to another archive, deleted their default archive, and then were thrown out of the invited archive - will see the dev version of the new onboarding flow (if we merge/deploy it)
				* There are no users in prod that currently have no archives
				* select accountId from account a left join account_archive aa using (accountId) group by accountId having count(*) = 0;
			* Cecilia and Jason are +1 on merging this sans styling, given that it is hidden behind url-hacking, but it's ultimately up to Natalie and Jason how to organize this
			* Defaulting "shares" (of a file or folder) to the old flow
			* setting up some path that always uses the new flow for testing
			* do a hacky thing where this branch always(?) sends the simplevo with false, or maybe do some window.location silliness, or whatever - not meant to be merged
	1. a/b testing??? (front or back end?)
		* Defaulting "shares" (of a file or folder) to the old flow; the front end should be able to detect when a user clicks a link from such an email. There is similar functionality for public timelines!
		* URLs for always old and new flows - query parameters
		* Should be easy to do on the front end, and it makes the most sense to do that there
			* This can also double as a feature flag
		* Inviting a user to be a member of an archive will want the new flow, but for the first iteration should use the old flow - this involves back-end changes that we're not sure we can make quickly
			* Long-term it would be better if this worked the same as other signups, but prioritization
			* Is this legacy, unused code for the web-client? That would be great! ...oh, this might be the placeholder accounts that are created when a user invites a non-user
			* TODO: Cecilia to test this; see when this code is actually triggered; and if it ever is, communicate when/where to Natalie
	1. Front end styling
		* Natalie has the designs; might need to rearrange some components due to design changes, but for the most part "just draw the rest of the owl"
	1. QA results / updates
		* Kaitlyn will be testing as we go
		* How can the rest of the team support?
			* Quicker reviews
			* Jason (and C?) might work on part 3, if N can outline a design

Thursday Feb 24 is probably the final deployment window before RootsTech on March 3-5 (thanks for putting that on the team calendar, C!)

Timeline:
	* Thurs 17: back-end#15 out
	* Thurs / Fri: get first front-end PR to dev; alert Kaitlyn that she can start QA (though no styling yet)
	* Tue 22: main front end changes deployed through environments
	* Tue 22: a/b testing always set to old flow deployed through environments (Jason)
	* Weds or Thurs: Deploy styling when ready
	* Weds or Thurs: Deploy changes from QA if any
	* Thurs 24: turn a/b testing to 50/50 (or whatever we want)
		* if for some reason this doesn't happen on Thursday but everything else is finished, could deploy this week-of. but... how would that happen?

Go / no go decision? Want input from the biz side - there's a risk of breaking things if we deploy week-of, but there's also consequences to not having the a/b test out for rootstech
	* If we miss a bunch of the timeline goals, then we'll decide not to shoot for rootstech, and take the pressure off

Maybe we should have a big QA session the week of RootsTech, to make sure the site as a whole is good to go?
	* C to talk with Robert about this, and schedule if so
