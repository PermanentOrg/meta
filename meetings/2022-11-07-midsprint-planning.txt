## Notes
	* rclone checkin
		* Dan / deployment:
			* Needs an account *without* required MFA (at least for now, until we discuss policy further)
			* Run build with that account
			* Deploy manually and see if it's possible to connect
			* THEN test on dev
			* And demo against dev
				* Cecilia plans to get rclone working locally and pull archive down
				* Need large test archive on dev (as well as the smaller one we can share)
		* Fon and Cecilia are working on download name script:
			* What happens if `downloadName` is null or `downloadNameOk` is false? This should be handled in the SDK
			* Discussion of the multiple folder_link entry problem: Fon's continuing to work on this
		* To dos: Dan deploying, Fon working on script, Cecilia will find/create good test archives on dev
	* Upcoming time off
		* Cecilia this week, Natalie next
		* Permanent closed for Veteran's Day
	* Mithuna's return is next Monday!
