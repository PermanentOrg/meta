# Purpose
Engineering team gets in sync on this week's goals and this sprint's status

# Outcomes
Review current status of some active tickets involved in recent work

# Previously

# Process (Agenda)
    * Share any good news ya' got!
    * Individual Issue Items
    * Open PRs
    * Deployments

## Roll Call
	* Cecilia
	* Dan
	* Liam
	* Natalie
	* Andrei
	* Fon

## Good News
	* Dan: Tried mowing the lawn, lawn mower exploded (ok well, a bolt fell off, but, that's kind of like exploding!)
		* Decided it was time to just move out of the gas powered life and buy an electric mower.  I really wanted a corded mower but sucked it up and got a battery powered one.
	* Liam: Started reading A Fire Upon the Deep, which I knew nothing about going in and turns out to be really good
		* My most recent sci fi read was This Is How You Lose The Time War
	* Natalie: this weekend in Phoenix AZ we had a high of less than 100 degrees F. (it will get hot again later this week though) .... oh.

## Tickets
https://permanent.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PER/boards/3
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service/issues
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues


## Notes
	* Plan for the node 18 updates is: Permanent team will try spinning up an instance and documenting the methodology, but in a time boxed way.  Otherwise we'll just merge in today and push things to dev, and test there.
	* SFTP updates
		* Fon and Dan are going to pair on refresh tokens - getting a strange response from Permanent back-end when testing
		* Dan's node change will be merged/deployed as described above
		* Cecilia and Dan will pair on returning more useful info from registerRecord
	* Sentry error quote depleted. Looks like this is because of the "trying to send some notification locally" problem. 
		* https://permanentorg.sentry.io/issues/3967826179/events/12dc78dad64a4ea587bac889b87f577f/
		* https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-9246 - would like to move this up so we don't run out of Sentry errors
	* Not repeating existing errors in metadata ingestion
		* Time + offset uniquely identifies a moment, but not a timezone
		* Saving more data than we're allowed to via reverse geocoding
		* Reverse geocoding address results aren't necessarily accurate
		* Current plan: switch to Open Street Maps and save a "city level" version of the address
			* This would imply switching to OSM on the front end as well, though we don't think that's blocking at the moment
			* Question about mobile as well
	* Pair Programming
		* pairing windows: 11-4 central / 9-2 Pacific / 7p - midnight Timisoara
			* Maybe just Fridays?
			* Cecilia/Andrei maybe on Mon/Weds around 9:15 Central / 5:15 Timisoara?
		* nudge?
			* emergency fixes - "I'm working on this and here's a call if anyone wants to join"
			* new section of this meeting for "what can we pair on?"
			* small nudge this week, hard nudge next week (signing up with times), then discuss in person

## Pairing
	* Upload test suite
	* registerRecord response
	* At some point there should be a nice, self-contained piece of metadata ingestion (location or date processing probably)

## Deployment
Cecilia (Weds)
* image build
