	* Goals for today:
		* Plan basic order of KRs
		* Schedule into sprints
		* Identify Asana milestones
		* Create and point tickets for next sprint at least

	* Pulling some notes from quarterly planning: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12lxd3eAY1P1P-PN4scR-cmn14T0JK2MhMJfxVu75Z-I/edit
	* Member data checklist (C)

		* Undo redirect (2)
			* Make sure to push from our newly transferred/created repo
			* Blocked by communication plan (exp team)
	* TheirStory on permanent-sdk (C)
		* This is in progress (on TS side)
		* v2 of backend endpoints (sprint 2)
		* add new endpoints to sdk (sprint 3)
	* Cache folders (N)
		* Build a folder caching system (5) (sprint 3)
		* Integrate caching into app (10) (sprint 4-5)
			* DataService cleanup
			* Find and centralize file system code that lives outside of DataService
		* Extra credit: Add move/delete to cache (2)
	* Archivematica (L)
		* Deploy Archivematica (10 points)
			* Determine deployment scheme (3) (sprint 2 of the qtr)
			* Set up infrastructure as code (5) (sprint 3)

		* Programmatically route uploaded files through Archivematica for processing (8)
			* Archivematica configuration design (2) (sprint 4)

	* Glam component library (N)
		* Build component library in web-app (8) (sprint 2 [both Natalie and Andrei], then sprint 4 with answers from Tibi/exp team)
			* Components:
				* Button
				* Toggle
				* Move pr-form-input into component library
			* Create a list of questions for Tibi (he returns Jan 29) (this is a ticket in itself)
		* Authentication (2) (sprint 5)
		* Navigation (3)
			* Account and archive menus
			* Maybe modal design as well
		* Major blocker is being sure we have the designs for the basic components (e.g. a button) before we start. Do these exist?
			* https://www.figma.com/file/lLHzIJcmkwkvdl3ipcjyKs/%5BApp%5D-Permanent?type=design&node-id=50-2&mode=design
			* Looks good, but not 100% complete
