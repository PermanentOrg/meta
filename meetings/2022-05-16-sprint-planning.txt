	* Liam
	* Fenn

## Good News
	* Mithuna:Nainika had a fun birthday party.
	* Dan: My parents closed on a new house!  (they haven't moved yet so expect another parent-house-related good news in future)
	* Got some quality time with friends
	* I made it out of the group stage of a historical fencing tournament for the first time last weekend
		* That's awesome!  How long have you been fencing?  (I remember being very bad at it in gym class X( )
			* I started in July 2018, so sort of 4 years, but also sort of 2.5 years because there was a long break during the height of the pandemic
	* Got to drive a ~fun car~ to see a friend in Wisconsin
		* What constitutes a ~fun car~? Speedy BMW!
	* Got some sleep! :)
		* Opposite of Mithuna's news :)In a good way though!

## Notes
	* Debian upgrade
	* Dan is working on getting his changes into PRs and merged
		* Note that the accepts-version v2 should be changed in the router, but there are a few controllers that don't follow the pattern so need to be removed first
			* Removing the Facebook controller: https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/pull/144
		* So: Takeaway is that I will prioritize Debian upgrade! \o/ üôè
	* TheirStory integration broke
		* Cecilia will make an issue
		* Maybe also related to the web-app errors?
	* Deployment windows - when is good for the new team?
		* Recently moved Thursday's earlier
		* Tuesday's was made for Jason's convenience, but it's after Cecilia's work hours
		* Will carry over to next week so that Natalie can be part of this conversation
	* Sentry errors: still waiting on this!
		* One example: is the Zoho script working?  Why is it sending so many errors?
	* Session related issue where user is not able to login and getting spinning wheels, but they are able to log in through incognito or other browsers
		* https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues/136
