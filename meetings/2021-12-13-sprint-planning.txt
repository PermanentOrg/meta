## Notes
Five weeks before the end of the year/quarter; this sprint and the next one.  What isn't accounted for in these two sprints that we've committed to as part of our quarterly goals?

## Good News

	* Cecilia: got to go cross-country skiing!
	* Dan: something about rearranging your office just feels... new and refreshing!  (I force pushed some layout changes; massive tech debt incurred, but the cleanup will be fun and rewarding, and the space is SO MUCH BRIGHTER!)
		* I also now have.... automated blinds.. Demo incoming.
			* They have IFTTT integration apparently. https://ifttt.com/neosmartblinds
	* Mithuna: Nainika got her first trophy.
	* Natalie: Tried new restaurants this weekend
	* Jason: new laptop is coming along!
	* Fenn : Working on first issue... (Reading code base also ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯)

## Auth

## Deployments
	* What's ready
		* web-app MFA verification copy - include phone number
		* unit test fix
		* Dan's whitespace fix
		* Maybe: login without archive? discuss in pr, maybe?
			* Probably wait for front-end changes because it is possible for this to have weird effects by itself
	* Who's deploying?
		* Cecilia, on Thursday

## Notes for next week
	* No Thursday deploy window next week
	* Only small changes going out next week
	* Note that RootsTech is coming and we'll want to do a freeze then
