        * BitBucket: https://bitbucket.org/dashboard/pullrequests?section=all&workspace=permanent-org

* Projects
	* Tag editing
		* On Mithuna. She knows what to do and will wait on blockers to be unblocked.
	* Notifications
		* Mobile team still has some blockers, including missing assets
			* Robert is working on text
			* Designer is out today, but is expected back tomorrow
		* Deployments?
			* App release: plan to submit to app store this week
				* Submitting to app store is distinct from releasing to public; we press a separate button to do the latter, at a time of our choosing.
			* We will need to do a infrastructure release to get the new secrets out - full image build & deploy. Will plan on doing that Tuesday or Wednesday
		* Mithuna to take a look at https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8394 and comment in the issue
	* Natalie to spin off new issue from https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-7945
		* https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8397
	* Website work - waiting on Cecilia to come back
