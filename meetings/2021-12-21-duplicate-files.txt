# Duplicate files and rclone

Purpose: Share status and validate path forward on the duplicate files portion of the rclone project.

Objective: Get experience team feedback on plan for duplicate files, especially wrt deletions.

Process:

	* Fon to share current status and plan
		* Goal: Sync Permanent with their local files (and eventually possibly Google Drive, etc)
		* One of the challenges is that Permanent allows files in a given folder to have the same name
		* If we have two files "myfile.txt" then the second will be renamed to myfile_1.txt
			* (I think currently: `myfile.txt_1`; we will need to fix that)
		* We store multiple pieces of information for each file:
			* original "uploadFilename"
			* "displayName" by default the filename without extension; can be edited by user
		* Plan is to add the "downloadFilename" field, defaults to "uploadFilename" but will be renamed for uniqueness as described above
		* Context that led to this plan:
			* Display name does not include extension; eg, uploading `resume.pdf` and `resume.doc` leads to two `resume`s in the Permanent UI
			* There are many existing duplicates, both of folders and files
		* Testing plan: remember to check copying and moving (i.e. cat.jpg exists in MyFiles and in Subfolder1, can I move/copy Subfolder1/cat.jpg into MyFiles and have everything work correctly?)
		* Concern: users would probably expect the downloadFilename to match the displayName
			* Will need to include the extension; options: use the content type we detect from the file contents, and map that back to an extension; or, use the extension of the uploaded filename (ie the last period and everything after it)
			* Display name does not have length or character restrictions (eg `/`) (displayName is 255 chars)
		* Option: expose new `downloadFilename` as an editable metadata field
		* We had previously determined, based on Cristina's research, that we would not try to enforce uniqueness of display names
	* Fon and Jason to describe the deleted files issue
		* We know this is a problem, we want to fix it, now might be the time
		* Kaitlyn, is there value to holding on to deleted files?
			* The "in the trash" concept
			* K: has not had such a support request
			* Mithuna has seen such support requests before Kaitlyn
		* https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-7959 Delete files as users expect
			* Decision from Sept 2020 was to hard delete and consider a trash can later
	* Kaitlyn feedback
	* Support process - KB articles, etc
		* Follow FusionAuth work plan: Prep users via newsletter then have KB articles ready to go when we launch



Next steps:
	* Kaitlyn needs to think about this some more!
		* She will talk to a power user or two
		* Question: what proportion of displayNames are different than the uploadFilename?
		* Basically: what's the relationship between uploadFilename, displayName, and whatever the new unique name is?
	* find Cristina's duplicates report spreadsheet and share with Kaitlyn
	* Fon to investigate the scope of work to make deletion work as expected in our code going forward
	* Next meeting second week of the year
