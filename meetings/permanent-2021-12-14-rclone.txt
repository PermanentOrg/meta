							Permanent Engineering Meeting (rclone), 2021-12-14

Attendees: Fon, Cecilia, Robert, Dan, Cristina, Jason, Karl

Agenda
	* Dan's Design Doc
		* https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mYMTJ5uE2MJ_GbvobhCXSFB8-N0Gd8_hfipQK96noqM/edit#
		* Discussion of WebDav vs SFTP
		* Cristina: why does this sit in front of S3?  Following the same pattern we use in web-app
		* Persistent connections: loss of connection would affect both/either
		* Guiding principles from Robert:
			* Put privacy and security ahead of functionality.  Privacy and security are primary.
			* Bias toward getting it right the first time -- move slow and don't break things.
			* Primary rclone use case is a "Pro User" use case, e.g., "Here's the client app, and here's a tutorial."  (We'll want to explore ways to build on rclone to connect with other systems, but right now we're not sure it'll be the best way to do that anyway.)
		* DECISION: SFTP
	* Duplicate folder/file name update
		* Fon is working on this
		* Could change the database so it has a unique constraint for downloadFilename, should be unique on the name AND folderId (as in, a unique multi-column index of [name, folderId])
		* TODO: Cecilia to give Fon permission to push new branches to the GitHub repository.
		* Issue: https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8610
	* Taskrunner scalability
		* PR https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/pull/9
		* Autoscaling for taskrunner - this is harder than we thought
			* Can't skip conversions for audio/video because we *use* the conversions in many cases
			* Hard because we have two queues per environment (high priority and video) and in fact all the tasks aren't even accounted for within these queues
			* To do this:
				* Everything would have to be in SQS (not true currently)
				* Add a service to monitor the queue length for both queues
				* When length > n, trigger CloudWatch alarm which causes the autoscaler to spin up more taskrunners
				* Change generate_inventory.sh to handle multiple machines
			* What Cristina actually can do
				* Clean up taskrunner
				* Refactor generate_inventory to let us spin up multiple taskrunners
