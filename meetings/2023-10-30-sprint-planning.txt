## Notes

	* Bulk gifting:
		* Combine "gift sent" and "invite sent" arrays to make the list in the design
		* If there are any emails in "invite already sent" then add a section that says something like "We couldn't send storage to: (list of emails)"
	* SFTP:
		* Token fix waiting on review for tmp storage change
	* GREAT job on sprint 214! 30 points done!
	* Carryover:
		* 5 pts in pr (count as half)
		* Need to point the multiple email gifting front end
		* 3 pts in progress
	* Last full sprint for AIR
	* Short sprint with holiday and some PTO
	* Upload test suite - should we push it off or carry it forward?
		* Natalie wants to get a little further so we kept it but might still move it to the backlog if it doesn't get to a good spot in this sprint
	* Gifting deployment - current state?
		* Should be able to go out with single recipient this week I believe
		* Emails should be working
		* Would be good to do another round of QA with emails and everything on main branches before deployment (Cecilia to arrange with Kaitlyn)
	* Front end architecture (thank you!)
		* Scheduling: Weds 9a Pacific / 6p EET

## Pairing
	* SFTP Slowness
	* CPU usage on WP
	* Member tag on Mailchimp (might need exp team help)

## Deployment
Natalie
	Probably on Wednesday
