Tag brainstorming

Checkin

Purpose: Get to know each other a little better and discuss Permanent's metadata entry system  

Outcomes: Cecilia has a path forward on designing the local/global tag system (or whatever we decide would be a better way!) and Kaitlyn knows more about the tech side of Permanent  

Process: 
	* 10 min hi/how are you/chat
		* Question: filetypes (full list), number of each (can use the contentType field in the "file" table for original files (not converted))
		* Better search for public galleries (yes!)
		* Can you move records from one archive to another that you own?  Kaitlyn may ask Mithuna about this


	* 10? min Cecilia describes what we have so far for metadata editing and the paths forward we've discussed 
		* Currently, metadata going into key:value pair tagging. Tags are global and not owned by any particular user, which means they can't be edited by users. Going forward, more like instagram hashtags?
		* Probably would want local tagging as well -- probably focused on power users at this point. Would we need a separate management page for controlled vocabulary/editing?
		* Kaitlyn will look at some other systems to see how they're distinguishing these
		* Cecilia will look for the thread in #public-mobile-dev about tag usage data
		* Cecilia will also link Kaitlyn to our existing metadata docs/notes
		* Kaitlyn will talk to Robert about the FHMWG (Family History Metadata Working Group)
		* Further potential to better explain what the system is capable of to help people use it - blog post?
		* Which date fields are editable?
		* Cecilia to write design doc for this project and then workshop with Kaitlyn / stakeholders

	* ?? min free-flowing conversation about the best options for users (including a migration plan) 
		* block/report mechanism for global tags (if they are publicly available)
			* Libraries are currently thinking about how to handle offensive historical material?  Outdated terminology/vocabulary - how should we manage this on Permanent?

Random other discussion - what dates do we have?  Where do they come from?


Roll Call
	* Cecilia
	* Kaitlyn
