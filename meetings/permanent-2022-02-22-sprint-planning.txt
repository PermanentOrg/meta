## Notes
	* Onboarding, aka account/archive separation
		* https://permanent-org.slack.com/archives/GC3MFJT4Y/p1644955936415519
		* A/B testing: https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8725
			* change function that calls endpoint to pass boolean parameter -> SimpleVO
		* Styling still feels feasible
		* Maybe J&N should pair on bugfixes?
		* Signing up after an archive invitation leads to the pending archive being the default archive, and the frontend cannot always detect that situation during signup (eg if the user does not click the link)
	* S3 PDF script & tags
		* Mithuna will work on this week
	* Deployments, migrations, and downtimes [deferred until Cecilia returns]

## Deployments
