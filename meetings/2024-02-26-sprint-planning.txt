## Notes
	* Photo cropping discussion
		* Andrei has found some libraries, but most of them assume the user would be uploading the item during the cropping flow
		* Flaviu suggested saving the cropped version of the image to Permanent, which we agree with :thumbs up:
		* Problem is in making sure that the image is available immediately for use as the profile picture
			* Yes, registerRecord returns a FileVO with a url in it for the "original" type
	* Point the GLAM ticket
		* Cecilia will start a thread about carousels and accessibility wrt this design
			* Some more detail: The AIR judging form categorized carousels as "distracting content". The suggested mitigation beyond just not using them is to either stop automatic movement after 5 seconds, or give the user a way to stop the automatic movement themself.
	* Pulled in the hard deletion task as a ticket
	* Mandrill template change

## Pairing
	* Tightknit local setup
	* More mob
	* Events endpoint

## Deployment
Natalie, backed up by Cecilia
