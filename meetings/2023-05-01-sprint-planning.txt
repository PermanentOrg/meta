## Notes
	* SFTP checkin
		* Dan's good at the moment
		* Fon found a stop at around 230 or 240 small files. He'll try with Filezilla to see if he sees the same thing there. We want to narrow down the problem space to see where this could be coming from.
	* Andrei has a holiday
	* Nail down the timeline for legacy planning / review sprints remaining in the quarter
	* Autogenerating API documentation for stela
	* Trouble getting Stela working locally
