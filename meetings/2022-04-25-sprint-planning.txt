	* https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/pull/80 - curators can't publish, but they should be able to rearrange already public things
 
## Tickets
https://permanent.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PER/boards/3
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service/issues
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues

## Notes
	* Improving the ratio of committed-story-points to completed-story-points (conversation from grooming last week): https://github.com/PermanentOrg/meta/commit/a551f8b4537c6012e1d38c384b2205211d9955ad
	* Debian upgrade - next week
	* Quick chat about "fix as we touch" changes for back-end
		* Fixing cases: "$Foo" -> "$foo"
		* Removing "VO"
			* eg "$archiveVOs" -> "$archives"
		* Utilizing type definitions in functions
		* (Explicitly requiring / avoiding autoload?)
		* (Static for BO methods when possible / easy?)
			* particularly when the only instance data is the database connection
			* skip when there are a ton of downstream effects
		* Dan will set up a PR template on back-end repo to track this checklist...or just links to a document about this! <-- I'll see if GitHub has a feature that lets you add documentation to a PR without it being in the "text entry" field / need to be deleted.  I may have invented that GitHub feature? Maybe it's real? WHO KNOWS!
		* Let's document our ongoing TODOs in a separate document, as well, that we link to from the PR template
	* Sentry Errors!
		* Maybe have a protocol for *new* Sentry errors - possibly even just a conversation in Slack
		* Bigger piece of work: don't use exceptions for expected things (like user not logged in anymore)
			* Could be related to v2 of response
		* Possibly also real errors around Zoho
		* Cecilia will make a proposal at next sprint planning

## Deployment
	* Weds: Mithuna will run pdf fixing script
	* Thurs: Natalie will do a deployment with image building
