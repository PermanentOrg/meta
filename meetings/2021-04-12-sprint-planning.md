### Priorities
	* Notification service
		* Milestone: https://github.com/PermanentOrg/notification-service/milestone/1
		* Load service with database https://github.com/PermanentOrg/infrastructure/pull/52 (today!)
		* Register devices 
			* API change https://permanent.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/1447067649/device (Mithuna will open a PR for this on Wednesday)
			* Notification service change: https://github.com/PermanentOrg/notification-service/pull/25
		* Send notifications to Firebase
			* Includes more secrets (Jason, midweek)
		* List of notifications: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oGbJhELrgtV25cNGQrBhKi3JdZYWOxfP/view 
			* Note that microservices auth will block any of these that come from cron and taskrunner; we broadly estimate that fixing the auth and deploying notification-service on the real internet would be a 6 week delay
				* All reminders and share summary are run on the cron machine
			* Device-new is not a real email / doesn't exist
