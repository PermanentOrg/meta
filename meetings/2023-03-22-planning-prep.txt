Looking at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IvhNoIC1tL79GVUG-TXbS2sWnARZuC6tI4PuKeA2m_c/edit#gid=940107053

	1. Check on "2022 Webapp Roadmap" tab and see where we are
	2. Look at mainstage roadmap to see what's next
		2.1. legacy planning - qa feedback, legacy contact, maybe more
		2.2. continued SFTP work (deletion, scaling)
		2.3. donation to an archive etc
	3. What isn't on there?
		3.1. Upgrade angular
		3.2. Upgrade FusionAuth
		3.3. Upgrade PHP + Debian
		3.4. Sentry cleanup!
		3.5. Crowdsourced ML training set of old photos for facial recognition
		3.6. FusionAuth "stuff" that needs to be finished - 2FA self service, getting rid of MFA on change password (unless we actually need it in a newer version)
		3.7. Web-app - maybe public gallery work, maybe the redesign (though the actual designs are still in progress)
			3.7.1. And some invisible restructuring to go along with this
	4. Note: rclone design meeting tomorrow for "allow delete over sftp" setting
	5. General commentary on how we do "pothole tasks"
		5.8. First sprint of the quarter reserved for them? Yes!
