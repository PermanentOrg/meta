## Notes

* Good news
    * My chicken is still alive
    * The development environment is now on github
    * I was pretty sure that I wouldn't finish this talk that I committed to, but I got an extension and am about to submit the recordings.
    * James is moving to a bigger apartment in the same building -- for the same rent!
    * Dan fought The Man and won!  (regarding a COVID-19 test fee)
    * Karl reached Paper Zero (but not Inbox Zero).


## Discussion of individual issues

* Dan:
    * Upload plans (TL;DR -- I'd like to create a new repo on github so I can document the plans / collect feedback in the open / get started.)

* Cristina:
    * Focusing on operational changes this week
    * Moving wordpress over to wordpress.com
        * Otherwise: institute a wordpress content freeze
        * Jason points out that Automattic's support is fantastic
        * They have processes for moving changes from dev to prod
        * They maintain a known-good plugin list
        * They have been known to do migration contracts
    * Lol, now that "operations" is on github, we should also probably rebuild our local development environment
* Will these notes be public?  (discussed; answer: yes, but of course anything confidential will be moved to somewhere private)

## Quick Things

* Schedules
    * Dan: Tue/Thu full Permanent; Mon/Fri attending regular meetings and at least available the rest of the day; Wednesday not doing Permanent but available for pings if needed.
    * Jason: goal is 4ish hours M-F, recently apocalyptic conditions have made that difficult


## Decisions

* Karl / James to arrange a meeting with Robert to talk about the value of migrating wordpress over to Wordpress.com

* Reiterating from last week: Dan to put these notes in a good place on github!

* Everyone should rebuild their dev environments now, since we've redone how they work


## Other
Also, I'm not sure who needs to see this, but it brought me some mind-blown-nostalga-joy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=WWbZFj-cLvk
