Backlog grooming

# Roll Call
	* Cecilia
	* Natalie
	* Mithuna
	* Liam

# Notes
	1. Database migration!
		1.1. https://permanent.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/2031321089/MySQL+-+PostgreSQL+Migration+Plan
		1.2. https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8498 (epic with all the related tickets!)
	2. Bigger backlog overview
		2.1. Wait until July / after the database is done
		2.2. Though no Mithuna :(
	3. Timezones, quickly?
		3.1. Front-end would need to add a new dependency
		3.2. Back-end needs to not have its own personal list of timezones
		3.3. Natalie thinks it's a good idea to *have* timezones, though - much nicer to show people times in their own timezone
			3.3.1. Can we just let the browser take care of it?
		3.4. Maybe we should learn something about archival best practices around time/date?
	4. Q3 goal ideas
		4.1. Cecilia's ideas:
			4.1.1. Finish upgrades
			4.1.2. File deletion
			4.1.3. Separate microservices onto their own servers
			4.1.4. Sign up through FusionAuth
			4.1.5. Session unlocking (cont.)
			4.1.6. Plan/start move away from PHP
