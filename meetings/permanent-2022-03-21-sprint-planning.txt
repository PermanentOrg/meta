## Tickets
	* https://permanent.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PER/boards/3
		* Mithuna will add her taskrunner results to PER-8507 
			* tasks are not getting requeued after being killed: cron tasks don't go through the queue, and queued tasks are taken off the queue at the beginning of processing (right?) [https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8507]
			* Mithuna will tag Dan and Karl - probably we need to have a call with the rclone group about these results
			* 
	* https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service/issues
	* https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues

## Notes
	* S3 PDF content type & multiple "original" files
		* Jason got some of the files updated with the script Mithuna wrote (yay) BUT we found an error that only exists in prod :(
		* Multiple "original" problem is still ongoing
		* Jason will create tickets for updating the script to ignore errors and for investigating the multiple "original" files issue more deeply, then mark this ticket as done
	* Downloadname PR
		* Account creation bug because the new code doesn't expect any folders to exist without parents - but of course they do!
	* Fon mentioned he is not able to use same account in local after vagrant destroy. 

## Deployment
	* Only Tuesday window
		* Merged PRs query: https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Amerged+is%3Apr+archived%3Afalse+user%3APermanentOrg+draft%3Afalse+-repo%3APermanentOrg%2Fpermanent-android+-repo%3APermanentOrg%2Fpermanent-ios+sort%3Aupdated-desc (sorted by recently updated)
		* Code cleanup
		* Natalie will deploy
