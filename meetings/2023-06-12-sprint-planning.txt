## Notes
	* Legacy planning:
		* Need to re-review and merge email changes
		* Some more QA responses
			* The update issue can probably be solved with a conditional within the query
		* MFA? Natalie will pick up PER-9284
	* SFTP refresh tokens
		* Cecilia to send link to etherpad plugin
		* Fon is traveling this week

## Deployment
Cecilia
- Need QA changes and new links for legacy planning to be done. Ideally Tuesday but likely Weds (maybe move the window earlier?)
