## Notes
	* Metadata manager - any blockers on deploying this?
		* All that's needed is the "Remove Metadata from tag manager" ticket
	* Deletion metadata retention - we store the object in the activity table
		* We do this to see what changed in the object
		* If we want to only store some amount of it, then it's not as useful to have a before-and-after, so should consider that if we go this route+1
		* (the activitybo has object type so it should be pretty easy to rebuild objects)

## Deployment
Natalie
- Note this includes image build, but if we need to be speedy to get the metadata out we can do images as a second round on Thursday
- Planning to deploy on Weds with image build
