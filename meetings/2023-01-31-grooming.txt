Backlog grooming
2023-01-31

## Topics
	* Ticketing and estimating front-end tasks better
		* What to do?
			* Do we want tickets to be deployable or parallelizable?
			* Could do subtasks on a ticket instead of epics with stories
			* What about the PR organization part?
				* We want to look into finding a tool that can isolate components so they are testable/clickable without being deployed
				* If we can do that, then let's merge subtask PRs straight to main. If not, then we'll make PRs onto a feature branch.
				* As Natalie (or whomever) works on tickets that build on earlier work, she'll branch off her branch and rebase on main once the earlier PRs are merged

	* Directives look-ahead (non stela deployment work)
		* https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-9095
	* Team changes
		* Picking up Mithuna's work (notably Retool)
		* Need to build a more explicit front-end backlog of tickets ready to be worked that don't need backend changes
		* And it would be helpful to have a list of front-end tickets that *are* waiting on backend changes
	* To be continued...
		* invite code reporting: https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-9150
		* Uploading files larger than 5gb: https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8718
		* directives table/schemas: https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-9099 (waiting for Liam)
		* directives front end tickets
		* "ready for work" front end backlog
		* mobile question: renaming multiple records to be implemented on client side on server side? (VSP-939)
