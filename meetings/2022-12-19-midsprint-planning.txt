## Pull Requests
https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+archived%3Afalse+user%3APermanentOrg+draft%3Afalse+-repo%3APermanentOrg%2Fpermanent-android+-repo%3APermanentOrg%2Fpermanent-ios
	* Long list but mostly small
	* Expecting new ones from Dan that would be good to turn around quickly but he will be able to move forward regardless

## Tickets
https://permanent.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PER/boards/3
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service/issues
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues
- PER-9090 is the unclaimed ticket that is unrelated to the custom metadata work that Natalie is doing

## Notes
	* Passing multiple data objects for deleting multiple Tags: it should work?
		* Confirmed that this works for delete tag <3
	* running downloadname script
		* Remember to check against root folders
		* Also on creation of root folders they need a downloadname!
		* Fon, if you're looking at this: I am hoping/anticipating that you are running the downloadname script on dev anytime you're at your desk so that we can continue to chew through it
	* Node 18!
		* Now the active version! Node 14 is EOL in April
		* upload-service
		* notification-service
		* permanent-sdk
		* donations-firebase
		* And in general, back to the upgrade conversation for Debian !

## Deployment
Holding off on deploying to prod this week
