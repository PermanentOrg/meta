## Notes
	* Top priority is getting app back to normal speed
		* https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core/apm/overview/MzIzOTI3M3xBUE18QVBQTElDQVRJT058MTU3OTI3MjcwNQ?account=3239273&duration=604800000&filters=%28domain%20IN%20%28%27APM%27%2C%20%27EXT%27%29%20AND%20type%20IN%20%28%27APPLICATION%27%2C%20%27SERVICE%27%29%29&state=74a105ed-4a6d-c4fa-c1fe-7020d521e273 -- what we did on Friday helped!
		* Deploying more fixes today
		* I do worry that there is something else going on that's making the API slow other than the deprecation issues
		* My next target here is the utf8_encode/decode methods
			* I see Stripe and Mandrill have some errors, so it might be worth updating those too
	* Two people had errors with logging in after changing their password - just an fyi for now
	* Janel's snapshot request - Liam is fine with doing this later this week
	* Another deploy later in the week - maybe discuss performance status at end of day tomorrow (Before Cecilia goes on vacation)

## Pairing
	* Group review: Angular upgrade?
	* Perhaps: repo transfer for TightKnit
	* Deprecation fixes continued!

## Deployment
Cecilia today
