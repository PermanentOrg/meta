			* Found a really nice authentic mexican place too!
			* (For those who actually haven't heard of IKEA, it is a huge swedish furniture store NOT actually a museum)
			* Other capitalistic activities
	* Natalie: Preparing for vacation
		* (And by that I mean staycation) yay! spring break!How long is this? <-- I think about a week (right?)
	* I went out for ice-cream and coffee (well because the elec company was doing maintainance work that took power away for 4 - 8 hours in different regions, so I had no option than to go out! It's really HOT here to when there's no power staying in doors could be hell)
		* What are some standard ice cream flavors (and what are some "weird" ones / ones maybe more unique to y'all)? Coconut, chocolate, coffee, vanilla flavors 
		* Do the ice creams get made locally or from a larger brand / factory? I was at a well known brand, but there are local brands as well....
			* Here's a really good brooklyn ice cream place if you ever find yourself nearby: https://amplehills.com/flavors
			* Relevant video about weird ice cream I suggest watching later: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjmzfOUOw08 LOL, thanks looks interesting can't wait to check it out later.
			* Also from Cecilia: https://www.bebezitomn.com/
