	* Overview of this sprint and what we're likely carrying forward
	* 
	* Renaming family to group!
		* https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8900 (Liam's new epic)
		* Other clients:
			* Check with node-sdk users to see if they're using the type field
			* Check with Dan and Fon to see if this affects the definition of Archive in the permanent-sdk
	* What's already in next sprint?
		* Jason : need help
			* record hard delete
				* New ticket for Liam: Delete this 
			* old upload code. Delete bad uploads
				* https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8252
				* https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8260
					* Is this still doing any work?  Should be checked as part of the ticket!
		* 2nd category of help
			* test code that is working 
			* opening PRs with not testing done
			* Liam would like to do the testing and he will ask questions in slack if feels blocked.
		* Danger: Jason needs to move forward and the amount of code that needs to be removed / changed is too great for him to finish completely if we want to hit our db upgrade goal.
		* MySQL to PDO should be in one go as methods are interdependable.
