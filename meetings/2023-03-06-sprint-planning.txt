- What's the next step on SSH statuses? (I see you closed this now so maybe moot)
	(answering in text for the record) -- there is none, the new statuses don't exist in the version of SFTP that the ssh2 library (and most of the world) implements, so we can't use them!

## Tickets
https://permanent.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PER/boards/3
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service/issues
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues

## Notes
	* Rclone checkin first
		* Blargh
			* I had to open a PR to upstream types to fix a bug I caused (short story, the ssh2 library supports v3 of the SFTP protocol, I had introduced status codes to the type library that were added in a later version).
			* Caching probably won't solve our deeper problems related to the "processing" state of a file.
		* For the service to respond with the expected response, Permanent needs to return:
			* file size of the original file
			* download url of the original file
		* Initially, we can poll for n seconds
		* capitalized extension breaks displayName (the extension isn't stripped out)
			* downloadName relies on this
			* Fon is fixing displayName logic
	* Liam is conferencing for most of the sprint, so aiming for ~16 points instead of 21
	* Need to add points to a couple tickets tentatively in Sprint 199
		* Moving https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-9133 forward and Cecilia will ask about those designs

## Deployment
Cecilia will do Thursday morning (assuming there are no conflicts)
