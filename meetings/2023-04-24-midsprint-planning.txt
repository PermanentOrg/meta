- TODO: assign back-end dependabots (which are failing)
- Dan will do sftp-service and permanent-sdk dependabots for now
- Holding off on web-app dependabots pending Angular upgrade

## Tickets
https://permanent.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PER/boards/3
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service/issues
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues

## Notes
	* Memcache on AWS
	* Production issues!
	* SFTP demo?
		* smooth!
		* Performance testing is ongoing
			* Cecilia to verify that @permanent.org accounts have unlimited storage
	* Web-app vs org repo secrets
		* Natalie remembers that we do want separate copies for web-app because they will be public by virtue of being in the web app (but not for deploy-only vars, which are not packaged in the app)
		* Workaround to find out if we have separate values would be to change a var name in the deploy action so we don't have to blow away secret values (at least not immediately)
	* Back-end dependabots - Cecilia


## Deployment
Natalie - Weds or Thurs
