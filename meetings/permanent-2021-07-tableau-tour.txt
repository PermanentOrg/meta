Invited: Robert, Thomas, Jason

Purpose: bring Jason up to speed on what visibility Robert has into the Permanent application by way of Tableau

Data sources
	* MySQL database - our prod2 read replica
	* Tableau extracts data locally to be able to more effectively iterate on queries, and avoid waiting for long-running queries; Robert refreshes weekly

Reports
	* Total users
		* filters: account_id
			* manually excludes non-personal staff accounts
			* Robert flags newly created test accounts weekly to add them to the filter
		* filter: status
		* filter: type, only includes completed accounts and not invited accounts
			* this is why the column exists in the database, even though the code does not use it after setting it
		* filter: primary email, removes the test accounts
	* Total Upload Volume
	* Weekly user acquisition
	* Weekly uploads (GB); also in Mithuna's report
		* also by #
	* Weekly invitations
	* Theirstory weekly (GB)
	* Theirstory by Archive
		* archive_id is painful; has a archive search saved
		* manually entering archive_id => display name mapping, which Tableau is able to apply globally
	* Weekly logins
		* comes from activity table, which contains every login event, and Robert filters by last login
		* could also do daily active users
	* Direct Signups by Token
		* invite codes keep track of where people came from
		* stacked bargraph, color coded by token (aka invite code)
		* maybe broken by code changes?

Missing reports?
	* not now, but next quarter: avg upload size for a new user
		* created account within last <time>
		* are we moving the needle between shortening the time between signup & uploads, and increasing the amount of data uploaded

Critical Tableau functionality? no
	* the GUI is kinda nice, but not entirely necessary

Robert knows some of the folks https://data.world/
