Current status:
	* Sending notifications on share of a file/folder to an archive or via a share link
		* However, in some cases a double notification is sent.  Any other information about this?

Today:
	* Send notifications with context, in general (in progress)
		* See https://github.com/PermanentOrg/notification-service/pull/31
		* Also needs a followup to https://github.com/PermanentOrg/notification-service/pull/30 (this is the biggest risk to slip)
		* Backend change: https://bitbucket.org/permanent-org/back-end/pull-requests/35
	* Specifically add context to the share notification that already exists (in progress)
		* See https://bitbucket.org/permanent-org/back-end/pull-requests/35
	* Deploy all this to staging
	* Doing all that would give you one notification with context to work on
	* I imagine we need to share user-visible text for these notifications, too - how would you like to do that?
		* Someone at Permanent will write this

Tomorrow:
	* Finish anything that slipped from today
	* Add next set of notifications (in progress):
		* approve/deny a request for access from a share link
		* notify on access granted after requesting access via a share link
		* See https://bitbucket.org/permanent-org/back-end/pull-requests/38

Then:
	* Remaining notifications
		* Acceptance of a folder or file share
		* Acceptance of membership in an archive 
		* Declining membership in an archive
