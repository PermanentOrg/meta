## Notes
	* Natalie out this week; Andrei has a holiday today; Cecilia is out on Friday
	* Are we ready to do an rclone delete demo?
		* Code is done, not sure about QA status
		* SDK needs to take the setting that now exists on back-end
		* Maybe we use a demo user with deletion allowed
	* Sentry error of the week: a notification error that shows up in local - might be worth checking in to see if there's a way we can avoid it, since it appeared almost 13,000 times this week
		* https://permanentorg.sentry.io/issues/3967826179/events/82703c8da34c4f18b590e0de7d07402b/
