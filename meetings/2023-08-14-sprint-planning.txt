## Tickets
https://permanent.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PER/boards/3
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service/issues
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues


## Notes
	* SFTP update
		* Dan needs review
		* Refresh token decision?
			* We could include it as a support step (disable MFA, register to the SFTP application). But currently we plan to just register each user to the application when they sign in to SFTP service specifically for the first time.
		* Currently working on adding error handling and optional retry to the SDK
		* Node 18 supports fetch natively... Should we just jump to requiring 18 for the SDK a month early ðŸ˜…
			* Yes, let's go to 18
	* Archive storage display question
	* QA for archive storage and login
	* PER-9336 discussion (registerRecord response for SFTP)
		* The relevant SFTP section: https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service/blob/6dcd3f75c2dfa92f640f4c656c680a3475304aa6/src/classes/PermanentFileSystem.ts#L297-L324
		* Relevant fields in the Record and File
			* https://github.com/PermanentOrg/permanent-sdk/blob/main/src/types/sdk/ArchiveRecord.ts
			* https://github.com/PermanentOrg/permanent-sdk/blob/main/src/types/sdk/File.ts
	* Thumbnail reprocessing:
		* Dev is done
		* Staging not done
		* Prod: many small batches? Larger batches overnight? To discuss with the whole team at staff meeting
