Diagnosing back-end issues

Purpose: teach Natalie and Jason how to figure out what's wrong / what's happening with the Permanent application when something unexpected happens

Example scenarios:
	* last week's upload spree breaking Robert's demo
		* Check AWS for queues esp HP ones
		* If in high need, can restart servers.
	* slack alert that uploads are stuck
		* Will check database for files uploaded in the last hour. Check its statuses. 
		* If it is a hige number will monitor the files wvery 30min to 1 hour to make sure thaqt it is passing along.
		* if I feel like the numbers are not coming down will check the AWS queues and status of High Priority queues
		* Also run htop on TR to see if there is anything suspicious.
		* Sometimes the system needs a service restart. Usually I start with queue daemon. 
			* sudo service process-daemon stop/start
				* hasn't been a problem in quite some time; probably won't need to do
			* sudo service queue-daemon stop/start
				* gets tasks from SQS, and runs them
				* this is the one to most likely need restarting
				* restart if tasks look stuck - long-running processes that don't appear to be making progress, or a lot of messages in the SQS queue but not much activity on task-runner
			* sudo service sqs-daemon stop/start
				* just for adding items to the SQS queue
				* check the queue folder in the disk
				* hasn't been a problem for quite some time
			* sudo service video-daemon stop/start
				* mostly hasn't been a problem?
	* Main point is with the new upload, users files are safe.
	* Statuses - record.status in the database
		* If files are in processing status, the user might experience thumbnail related issues mainly
		* If files are in converting status it is okay.
		* Statuses in prod
			* processing 3
			* reprocessing 
				* if processing fails 5 times, then mark it as reprocessing
				* we might not be doing reprocessing any more?
			* needs_processing 2
			* uploaded 1
			* converting 5
			* needs_converting 4
			* only_meta 
				* not sure how this happens; may be an artifact of the old upload process
			* manual_review 
			* error
			* deleted
	* Query 
		SELECT distinct status, count(status)   
		FROM perm.record   
		where  
			status NOT IN ('status.generic.ok' ,'status.record.only_meta', 'status.generic.deleted') 
		 and  
			(createdDT > NOW() - INTERVAL 5 hour and createdDT < NOW() - INTERVAL 15 MINUTE ) group by status;
			
			Suspicious activity
			Jason: TR task running longer than more than a minute or 2.
