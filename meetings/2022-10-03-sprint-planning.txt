	* Looks like mobile is using a couple back-end endpoints that we aren't using in the web-app, based on Sentry deprecation notices

		* getbyplace
		* Cecilia to talk to them about moving to different endpoints for these tasks so we aren't maintaining separate ones for web and mobile!

		* Also, holiday on Monday!

	* SFTP/rclone status
		* PR for deployment expected on Wednesday!
		* Fon's PRs are moving along
	* Point out "how to bring WP site back up" so more people know about that resource
		* https://permanent.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/2047508481/Restoring+From+a+Lightsail+Snapshot

## Deployment
	* Cecilia's turn; probably Thursday (would like to have all the endpoint optimizations and maybe even share changes out this week, so Wednesday if they're ready then)
