2022-04-21 Engineering Backlog Refinement
Present: Cecilia, Jason, Mithuna


	* Velocity report
		* We're committing to much more than we're achieving
		* One option is to change to 3-week sprints, which would help mitigate the impact of long PR review times
		* Noting that we have some estimated stories in the current sprint that we don't intend to get done
		* Working more as a team, rather than a bunch of individuals: once one person finishes "their" stories, start helping on teammates' stories instead of pulling in future work
		* Prioritization and PR review time to avoid carryover and swingy velocities
			* Proposed priorities: emergencies (management direction, helping member success team, hotfixes, etc), review teammates' PRs, address review comments on own PRs, completing open stories, starting new stories
			* Balancing review time amongst the team
		* Estimates SHOULD include estimated impact on team for reviewing & testing changes; changes that are quick to dev but slow to review/test should be bigger
	* User backlog: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_N9ZSy_IIKCv774NYHeybbN5cxc8bnrHezkB56wYBzU/edit#gid=0
	* Upgrade all the things
		* MySQL upgrade process -> tickets
			* https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-8498: Jason will turn this into an epic, make subissues, and estimate them
		* Debian
			* Would be convenient to do this before MySQL -> Postgres
	* Backlog: https://permanent.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/PER/boards/3/backlog?issueLimit=100
		* Goal of 7 points/person
		* Mithuna to create ticket for taskrunner audit and put in sprint 180
		* hevc video issue
	* Liam! Sprint 180
