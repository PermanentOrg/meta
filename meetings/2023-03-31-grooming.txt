Cecilia and Natalie

Pothole sprint
	* include the allowSftpDeletion flag
	* uptime robot changes
	* mobile changes
	* Angular upgrade?
Natalie and Cecilia are thinking that we'll carry over any (genuinely) in-progress or pull request tickets to the pothole sprint, but not ones that haven't been picked up yet so we can focus on the actual potholes.

KR estimation / questions
	* Export/import metadata
		* merge or replace on import?
	* Storage improvements (***)
		* Gift storage from one account to another (this exists on the backend so far as I, Cecilia, can tell at a quick glance)
		* Set an account as payer on an archive
			* Assumption: we want people to be able to keep going as they have been (i.e. don't want to default to making the archive owner the payer or something)
			* everywhere we bill, add a check "does the destination archive have a payer? if so, bill them"
			* Not a huge change in itself, but a bit dangerous since we'd have to make sure not to miss anywhere
			* UI for setting the payer and a place that information (field on the archive table?)
			* Question: would there be a requirement (or desire) to show the payer's available storage on the archive somewhere?
		* Give storage directly to an archive
			* rewrite how billing/storage works
			* or have secret accounts and use those as the payer? < I like this cause it's 2 birds one stone ;) It'll solve the payer account problem and the funding an account problem
	* SFTP
		* Need the deletion flag, but that's just a migration
		* Hard delete has stalled
	* Download different filetypes
		* want a design
		* back-end needs to send all available files for a record to the client (if it doesn't already)
		* then present the available files
		* also some KB work to explain why you may or may not have multiple download options (which implies some backend investigation work, most likely)
		* test this with every file type that we say that we support / convert
	* Data visualization/reporting (checklist)
		* cowpaths spreadsheet Kaitlyn made: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F8aCf7hXRHvCDukHs3OXb9_pCmruffoHW1SCQVpIl30/edit?usp=sharing
			* (Kaitlyn hid the columns she doesn’t want)
		* Imagining a retool dashboard
		* Individual? Group? Over time? (Guesses:)
			* % opted in to the newsletter for time period
			* Cross reference? (people who opted in to the newsletter and opened welcome email?)
			* Both! Want the table view of individuals and filtering/grouping options
				* Everyone ever, but recent changes should appear at the top
				* “Average time between account creation and upload” would be interesting (chunked to see changes? Or average forever?)
	* Onboarding goal setting (not bad!)
		* multiple screens?
		* is it one screen with multiple checkboxes? then send info on to MailChimp?
			* get a design for the screen
			* build the new screen (3? depends on what it looks like!)
			* add a backend endpoint that translates info to mailchimp tags and sends them there (also 3?)
			* could include some onboarding cleanup here - e.g. accept all invitations
	* Launch legacy planning


Move sprint planning earlier on Monday
