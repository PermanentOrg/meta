## Notes
	* Account storage bug:
		* for accounts without 2fa, is this done?
		* make a ticket to add storage to the response from the verify endpoint too
	* Where should images and text come from for new signin screen?
		* Exp team todo: choose the images and text
		* Backend todo: Set up a source for the images - current thought is a table with the text and links to the images (ideally those would be settable through the admin panel too, but that's not MVP)
			* Cecilia: make ticket(s) and schedule
		* Frontend todo: Create a fallback
			* Andrei will get this into a reviewable state with placeholder images and text
	* Brainstorm test deploy ideas for TightKnit
		* Backend: add a field to an endpoint response? (we want something we can check after deploy)
		* Frontend: small text change
	* Checklist endpoint(s): one? several?
		* option 1: get all events for a user
		* option 2: endpoint could know about existing checklist items - let's do this
		* option 3: endpoint takes input from front end about specific kinds of events (so we could add a checklist item just on the front end)
		* Note: if account was created before (date when all checklist events begin to be recorded) then default checklist to hidden
	* Other work that should be started soon:
		* Reference: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v7K3S4hzvnRMdB9sxDBsVAJovGZUPZ7CWnZe2jQekb4/edit#heading=h.c97ktqyv9hd3
		* Review account space code
		* Set up OAuth in Retool
		*
