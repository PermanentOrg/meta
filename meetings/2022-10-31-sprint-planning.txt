## Notes
	* SFTP demo prep
		* Run downloadName script
		* Focus on deployment to prod. Creating records/folders is a bonus.
		* Cecilia plans to make a snapshot ahead of time and use dry run/logging ahead of time
		* Fon update: he is not feeling well but getting better. 
			* Expects to have tests added to PR by tomorrow
	* FA upgrade - this can't really happen this week, we decided
		* Ideally front end change done and deployed on Weds
		* If that happens, Cecilia will do dev upgrade Thursday morning, can ask for help in the call on Thursday midday and we can try the upgrade on prod that afternoon
	* Welcome email changes
		* Two options: 
			* create a separate invite code and send a new email (and give different storage) (we'd like to do this and already have separate storage for separate invite codes, so this is really just making the new email)
			* or change the storage and welcome email for everyone
	* Database migration cleanup
		* Cecilia planning to have a PostgreSQL audit done
	* Cecilia out the second half of next week (except for demo of course)
	* Can't forget stela, metadata, sharing

## Deployment
	* Natalie?
