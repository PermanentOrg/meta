## Tickets

https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues

## Notes
	* Fon will share some errors he's getting on signup locally
	* Admin auth on stela discussion
		* Lots of ways to authenticate from Retool, including OAuth!
		* FusionAuth will have an admin application, users will log in to that
		* Retool can pop up a login to FusionAuth if we want (then use the redirect uri, Cecilia thinks, to send back the right token to Retool)
		* Then an admin endpoint will require the user to have authenticated through the admin app in FusionAuth
	* Directives planning - some tickets are in the epic but not yet in sprints.


## Deployment
	* Natalie
	* Maybe hold off on this because of welcome email changes? (to confirm with Kaitlyn)
