Q1 planning in more specifics

	1. Email updates: https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-9112
		1.1. This is reasonably urgent so the exp team can start tracking, but most of the tickets are very small.
		1.2. Groomed and scheduled
	2. Change password bug: https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-9116 (quick one)
	3. Public share links: https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-9093
		3.1. Add concept of "public or not" to share links themselves (in the database)
		3.2. Change endpoint (which?) to understand the idea that some share links are public
			3.2.1. And if the share link is public, return more info - the largest size thumbnail?
				3.2.1.1. Perhaps just add the entire record to the response here to avoid the secondary call with proof-of-public-share-link attached. Actually it's here!
		3.3. 
			3.3.2. Click on the thumbnail (in preview) and instead of popping up "log in" or whatever, make another call to record/get that passes the share link along as an authentication (ish) mechanism to avoid people guessing the record id and calling this endpoint with the "this is from a public share link, I promise!" addition
			3.3.3. Is it easy to do this for photos (i.e., if we're already passing the largest thumbnail size)? Could we do that as a start and treat other kinds of records differently?
		3.4. Never "finish" the share - this is essentially just a big preview and it will never end up in the recipient's archive (unless they do have an account...in which case it works like a regular share link?)
	4. Stela deployment: https://permanent.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/2063990785/How+Should+a+New+Deployment+System+Look
