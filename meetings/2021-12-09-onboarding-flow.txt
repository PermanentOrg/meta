Where does the front end need to call the backend?
	* auth module of web-app
	* check on both login and signup for whether the person has any archives
		* if not, redirect to onboarding flow (/onboarding for now)
		* CHANGE? response from login and signup should *not* respond with an archive on the new flow.
	* in onboarding flow:
		* TODO: check that the logged-in user does not have archives (verification)
		* create new archive component is already wired up to backend!
		* TODO: wire up the "get list of pending archives" (Cecilia to find the endpoint for this)

What we need to do:
	* Natalie: Implement design 
	* Cecilia: Allow a/b testing on the backend
	* Cecilia: Allow response from login/signup with no archive on backend (PER-8552)
	* Natalie: Verify that the logged-in user doesn't have any archives ( to prevent navigating to this page)
	* Natalie: Wire up "list of pending archives"
