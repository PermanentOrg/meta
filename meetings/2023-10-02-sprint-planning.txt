## Notes
	* SFTP update
		* Performance testing!
		* Rclone has changed behavior and now tries to upload partials
			* Need to update documentation to include this tag
		* Tests are using one user with different connections, so sharing a cache. Didn't crash with 5 connections! Uploads worked. Definitely noticeably slower on the web client while the uploads were happening.
		* CPU was the limitation (thanks Fon)
	* Andrei can test gifting with backend in https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/tree/per-9327-invite-gifts (just needs tests)
	* Schedule conversion doc work this week

## Pairing
	* Design doc
