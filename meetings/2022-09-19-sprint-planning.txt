https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues

## Notes
	* Bug week (Prue gif?)
	* folder/getWithChildren will now only return one level of children instead of grandchildren etc. That should work fine for the SDK.
		* https://github.com/PermanentOrg/permanent-sdk/blob/main/src/api/__tests__/fixtures/getFolderVo/folder.json is what the SDK expects to get back from that endpoint, fyi
	* This week's  rclone goal: make a deployment plan for SFTP service! (That way Dan can work on it while we're in Albuquerque next week)

## Deployment
	* Liam will do probably Wednesday
