## Tickets

https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service/issues
https://github.com/PermanentOrg/back-end/issues

## Notes
	* Let's free Dan and Fon as early as possible, so: what do you need from us for SFTP stuff?
		* Can do the minimum on edge cases for creation
		* Status of folder downloadName on dev
			* So far, it has normalized about 2500 folders, from 6900 we should be left with about or slightly above 4000 folders now. The script is still running, this should be from a total of about at least 6 sessions each averaging 3 hours
				* So it has taken 18 hours to do 2500 folders?Yes, seems like it.
		* Any needed reviews?
			* Not at the moment
		* Devenv bugs:
			* https://github.com/PermanentOrg/devenv/issues/58
			* https://github.com/PermanentOrg/devenv/issues/57
			* Mention Stela in documentation
		* Upload file size: https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sftp-service/issues/48
			* Need to make sure that S3 won't charge us/the user for reserved but unused space, in this plan
	* Q1 2023 to dos
		* Split up CRUD endpoints into separate tickets for legacy contacts and directives themselves

	* Repo consolidation work:
		* Close Bitbucket account
			* We have 1 active repo on BitBucket (email). Would need to move that to GitHub and set up CI there. Also get Kaitlyn set up with the new remote.
			* Decide where to archive other repos (if they weren't moved to GitHub already)
			* Figure out how to close the account!
		* Consolidate repos
			* Various scripts: migrate-permanent-auth0, migration-permanent-fusionauth, duplicate_file_paths, probe-deleted-files (and archive)
			* upload-service and notification-service (into stela)
		* Investigate repos
			* https://github.com/PermanentOrg/sqs-count-custom-metric ?
			* fs-php-lite?
			* ep_permanent_exporter (possibly to archive)
			* vis-timeline
		* Archive repos
			* .github
			* pledge dashboard (and remove deployed copy)
			* ios-autocomplete (confirmed with mobile team)
		* Repos to keep (12) (could consolidate some of these too, most likely)
			* functional test
			* fusionauth templates
			* stela
			* meta
			* sftp-service (or should this be part of the stela monorepo?)
			* permanent-android
			* permanent-ios
			* permanent-sdk
			* devenv
			* web-app
			* infrastructure
			* back-end
		* Move TheirStory to new SDK
			* archive node-sdk and test-node-sdk
	* https://permanent.atlassian.net/browse/PER-9093 (public ish share link)
	* Custom metadata ready to deploy? No, needs to be cleaned up, put in PR, merged, etc

## Deployment
It looks like Liam's turn aiming for Tuesday (today)
