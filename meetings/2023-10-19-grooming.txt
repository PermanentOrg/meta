Grooming

Notes
	* Quick points for next sprint
	* Do we need any further tickets for gifting?
		* No but PER=9322 is blocked because it will happen in stela now
		* Design reviewed and all good!
	* Discussion of metadata in stela vs metadata via archivematica
		* Liam thinks: Archivematica calls a webhook, which creates an event, which lambdas listen for
	* Need another SFTP ticket in next sprint
		* Added one as a placeholder to make sure we keep moving forward on this KR.

KR checkin
	* AIR (ongoing)
	* Gifting (ongoing)
	* New accounts -> member journey (related to invite code work just done)
		* Cecilia to make or schedule an epic for this
	* TheirStory roadmap
	* SFTP bugs (in progress)
	* File conversion doc (paused but in progress)
	* Metadata in stela
